## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Went Well
- Parallel research (ismy.blue + ccff00.com styling)
- Incremental changes with immediate testing
- Clear communication on design decisions
- Efficient debugging (identified root causes quickly)

### What Was Challenging
- Balancing ismy.blue functionality with CCFF00 aesthetics
- Avoiding #CCFF00 color comparisons while testing #CCFF00
- Managing JavaScript scope issues with boundary calculations
- Removing features after building them (CTA, stats)

### What's Next
- Database setup (manual cPanel configuration needed)
- Population statistics (once data flows in)
- WordPress article (after database verified)
- Social sharing features (future enhancement)
