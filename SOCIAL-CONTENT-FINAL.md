### LinkedIn Post #1: Technical Angle

**Nobody asked for this. Built it anyway.**

I created a colour perception test for cifeaux (#CCFF00) inspired by the viral ismy.blue that hit 1.5M visits in a month.

Six adaptive questions. 13-colour pool. Binary yes/no choices. Reveals whether you're a Purist (only #CCFF00 qualifies) or a Visionary (every yellow-green is cifeaux if you believe hard enough).

**The point?** Exploring what it means to own a colour culturally through tools that teach people what it is. Style guides nobody reads < interactive experiences people share.

Built in 8 hours. Single HTML file + MySQL backend. Zero dependencies. Vanilla JS. WCAG AA contrast ratios throughout. Database tracking every result.

This is what AI-assisted development enables: same-day shipping of brand-exploring tools.

### LinkedIn Post #2: Brand Strategy Angle

**Brand education disguised as play.**

Question: How do you teach people what your brand colour is without publishing a PDF nobody reads?

Answer: Build an interactive test that makes the learning accidental.

"Is My Cifeaux?" tests whether yellow-green shades qualify as the official #CCFF00. Every user who takes it learns:
- The official hex code
- The pronunciation ("cifeaux")
- The acceptable range
- The brand personality

Then: brands published style guides. Now: brands build experiences. The shift: engagement beats documentation.

Inspired by ismy.blue (1.5M visits). Adapted for cultural brand exploration. Shipped in 8 hours with database integration.

Conversion through education. Education through play.

### LinkedIn Post #3: Philosophical Angle

**If Pantone owns colour systems and Tiffany owns robin's egg blue, can an individual explore owning cifeaux?**

Is that even possible? Is it art, or branding, or performance, or all three?

If not me, who? If not now, when?

I built a colour perception test that teaches people what #CCFF00 is through interaction rather than documentation.

Six adaptive questions. 13-colour spectrum. Binary choices. Humorous verdicts (Purist to Visionary). 30 seconds to complete.

This isn't the product. This is proof of what one person can create now:
- Style guides
- Colour tests
- Design systems
- Accessible palettes
- Database infrastructure

Every project is a proof point. The diversity is the point.

Things that used to need teams, investors, or a lifetime of skill refinement.

### LinkedIn Post #4: Viral Mechanics Angle

**1.5 million people took ismy.blue to find out if their turquoise leans blue or green.**

Why? Because nobody agrees on colour boundaries, and discovering your personal bias is inherently interesting.

I adapted the same mechanics for cifeaux (#CCFF00):
- Binary choices (low friction)
- Adaptive difficulty (intelligent branching)
- Progressive challenge (obvious → ambiguous)
- Social comparison (shareable results)
- Immediate results (no email gates)
- Educational value (learn the official hex)

Result: Brand education that people actually want to share.

Built in 8 hours with AI assistance. Single HTML file + backend. Mobile responsive. WCAG AA compliant. Database tracking for future insights.

This is the new bar: ship interactive tools, not static docs.

nobody asked for a colour perception test for cifeaux but here we are

🧵 how adapting viral mechanics to brand exploration works

---

**Thread:**

1/ ismy.blue hit 1.5M visits in a month by exploiting a simple truth: nobody agrees where blue ends and green begins

the format works because discovering your perception bias is inherently shareable

2/ adapted the same mechanics for #CCFF00:
- 13 shades (pure yellow → lime green)
- adaptive algorithm
- binary yes/no: "is this cifeaux?"
- immediate results
- social comparison
- personality verdict

3/ your choices reveal your relationship to brand boundaries:

Purist: only #CCFF00 qualifies (it's a religion not a range)
Visionary: all six shades count (you're either enlightened or colourblind)

4/ real goal: brand education through interaction

every user learns:
- official hex (#CCFF00)
- pronunciation (cifeaux)
- acceptable range
- brand personality

style guides < interactive experiences

5/ technical: single HTML file + MySQL backend, zero frontend dependencies, vanilla JS

WCAG AA contrast ratios throughout
mobile responsive (fixed hover states)
gradient results visualisation
built in 8 hours with AI assistance
database tracking

6/ exploring what it means to own a colour culturally

can one person claim a shade the way Tiffany owns robin's egg blue?

only if you build the infrastructure to prove it's possible

## Reddit Post (for r/webdev, r/design, r/userexperience)

**Title:** Built an adaptive colour perception test in 8 hours (single HTML file + MySQL, zero frontend dependencies)

**Body:**

Inspired by the viral ismy.blue test (1.5M visits in a month), I built a colour perception test for my brand colour cifeaux (#CCFF00).

**The format:**
- Shows 6 adaptive questions from 13-colour pool
- Binary yes/no: "Is this cifeaux?"
- Intelligent branching based on user's yellow/green bias
- Results show accepted range + perception bias
- Personality-based verdict (Purist to Visionary)

**Technical approach:**
- Single HTML file for frontend
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- CSS gradients for results visualisation
- Mobile responsive (flexbox + clamp())
- Fixed hover states for touch devices
- PHP + MySQL backend for persistence
- Google Analytics integration
- WCAG AA contrast ratios
- Full keyboard navigation support

**Build time:** 8 hours from concept to production with AI assistance (including mid-project pivot from Vercel to cPanel, database integration, and mobile UX polish)

**Why it works:**
- Low friction (binary choices)
- Adaptive difficulty (intelligent branching)
- Progressive challenge (obvious → ambiguous)
- Immediate results (no email gate)
- Social comparison (shareable verdicts)
- Educational value (teaches the official brand colour)

Happy to answer questions about the approach or implementation.

P.S. I'm either a Purist or completely delusional. The test says Purist.
