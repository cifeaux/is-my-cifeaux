# Social Content: Is My Cifeaux?

## LinkedIn Posts (5 Variations)

### LinkedIn Post #1: Technical Angle

**Nobody asked for this. Built it anyway.**

I created a colour perception test for cifeaux (#CCFF00) inspired by the viral ismy.blue that hit 1.5M visits in a month.

Six shades. Binary yes/no choices. Reveals whether you're a Purist (only #CCFF00 qualifies) or a Visionary (every yellow-green is cifeaux if you believe hard enough).

**The point?** To own a colour culturally, you need tools that teach people what it is. Style guides nobody reads < interactive experiences people share.

Built in 4 hours. Single HTML file. Zero dependencies. Vanilla JS. WCAG AA contrast ratios throughout.

This is what AI-assisted development enables: same-day shipping of brand-reinforcing tools.

### LinkedIn Post #2: Brand Strategy Angle

**Brand education disguised as play.**

Question: How do you teach people what your brand colour is without publishing a PDF nobody reads?

Answer: Build an interactive test that makes the learning accidental.

"Is My Cifeaux?" tests whether yellow-green shades qualify as the official #CCFF00. Every user who takes it learns:
- The official hex code
- The pronunciation ("cifeaux")
- The acceptable range
- The brand personality

Then: brands published style guides. Now: brands build experiences. The shift: engagement beats documentation.

Inspired by ismy.blue (1.5M visits). Adapted for cultural brand ownership. Shipped in 4 hours.

Conversion through education. Education through play.

### LinkedIn Post #3: Philosophical Angle

**If Pantone owns colour systems and Tiffany owns robin's egg blue, why can't an individual own cifeaux?**

If not me, who? If not now, when?

I built a colour perception test that teaches people what #CCFF00 is through interaction rather than documentation.

Six colours. Binary choices. Humorous verdicts (Purist to Visionary). 30 seconds to complete.

This isn't the product. This is proof that someone who commits to a brand builds infrastructure around it:
- Style guides
- Colour tests
- Design systems
- Accessible palettes

Each artifact builds authority.

Every tool shipped proves what one person with AI can create now.

### LinkedIn Post #4: Viral Mechanics Angle

**1.5 million people took ismy.blue to find out if their turquoise leans blue or green.**

Why? Because nobody agrees on colour boundaries, and discovering your personal bias is inherently interesting.

I adapted the same mechanics for cifeaux (#CCFF00):
- Binary choices (low friction)
- Progressive difficulty (obvious → ambiguous)
- Social comparison (shareable results)
- Immediate results (no email gates)
- Educational value (learn the official hex)

Result: Brand education that people actually want to share.

Built in 4 hours with AI assistance. Single HTML file. Mobile responsive. WCAG AA compliant.

This is the new bar: ship interactive tools, not static docs.

🧵 how adapting viral mechanics to brand education works

---

**Thread:**

1/ ismy.blue hit 1.5M visits in a month by exploiting a simple truth: nobody agrees where blue ends and green begins

the format works because discovering your perception bias is inherently shareable

2/ adapted the same mechanics for #CCFF00:
- 6 shades (pure yellow → lime green)
- binary yes/no: "is this cifeaux?"
- immediate results
- social comparison
- personality verdict

3/ your choices reveal your relationship to brand boundaries:

Purist: only #CCFF00 qualifies (it's a religion not a range)
Visionary: all six shades count (you're either enlightened or colourblind)

4/ real goal: brand education through interaction

every user learns:
- official hex (#CCFF00)
- pronunciation (cifeaux)
- acceptable range
- brand personality

style guides < interactive experiences

5/ technical: single HTML file, zero dependencies, vanilla JS

WCAG AA contrast ratios throughout
mobile responsive
gradient results visualisation
built in 4 hours with AI assistance

6/ if Pantone can own colour systems and Tiffany can own robin's egg blue, you can own cifeaux

but only if you build the infrastructure to prove it

## Instagram Caption

**Is this cifeaux?**

Built a colour perception test inspired by the viral ismy.blue (1.5M visits in a month).

Six shades from pure yellow to lime green. Answer yes/no for each. Get a personality verdict: are you a Purist (only #CCFF00 qualifies) or a Visionary (every shade is cifeaux if you believe)?

**Why?** To own a colour culturally, you need tools that teach people what it is. Brand education disguised as play.

Built in 4 hours. Single HTML file. Zero frameworks. WCAG AA accessible. Open-source on GitHub.

This is what brand commitment looks like when you ship tools instead of talk about shipping tools.

## Reddit Post (for r/webdev, r/design, r/userexperience)

**Title:** Built a colour perception test in a single HTML file (zero dependencies, 4hr build time)

**Body:**

Inspired by the viral ismy.blue test (1.5M visits in a month), I built a colour perception test for my brand colour cifeaux (#CCFF00).

**The format:**
- Shows 6 shades across yellow-green spectrum
- Binary yes/no: "Is this cifeaux?"
- Results show accepted range + perception bias
- Personality-based verdict (Purist to Visionary)

**Technical approach:**
- Single HTML file
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- CSS gradients for results visualisation
- Mobile responsive (flexbox + clamp())
- WCAG AA contrast ratios
- Full keyboard navigation support

**Build time:** 4 hours from concept to deployment with AI assistance

**Why it works:**
- Low friction (binary choices)
- Progressive difficulty (obvious → ambiguous)
- Immediate results (no email gate)
- Social comparison (shareable verdicts)
- Educational value (teaches the official brand colour)

**Email Body:**

**Is this cifeaux?**

Colour perception tests went viral because they prove something we already suspected: your blue isn't my blue.

I built one for cifeaux (#CCFF00).

**The format:**
Six shades across the yellow-green spectrum. Binary yes/no for each. Personality verdict at the end (Purist, Connoisseur, Pragmatist, Expansionist, Visionary, or Skeptic).

**Why build this?**
To own a colour culturally, you need tools that teach people what it is. Style guides nobody reads < interactive experiences people share.

**Technical details:**
- Single HTML file
- Zero dependencies
- Vanilla JS
- 4-hour build time
- WCAG AA accessible
- Open-source (MIT)

P.S. I'm either a Purist or completely delusional. The test says Purist.
