- 13-color adaptive pool (#EEFF00 to #99FF00)
- Binary choice: "This is cifeaux" / "This is not cifeaux"
- First-question error detection
- Personality verdicts (6 types)
- Boundary calculation with personalized analysis
- Visual gradient showing accepted range
- Pixelated #CCFF00 confetti on completion
- About modal explaining the CCFF00 project

## Database Insights You'll Get

Once deployed and collecting data:

```sql
-- Verdict distribution
SELECT verdict, COUNT(*) as count
FROM cifeaux_results
GROUP BY verdict;

-- Average accepted shades by verdict
SELECT verdict, AVG(accepted_count) as avg_accepted
FROM cifeaux_results
GROUP BY verdict;

-- Yellow vs Green bias
SELECT bias, COUNT(*) as count
FROM cifeaux_results
GROUP BY bias;

-- Daily test volume
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as tests
FROM cifeaux_results
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

1. **Deploy to cPanel**
   - Follow `CPANEL-DEPLOYMENT.md` step-by-step
   - Create database
   - Upload files
   - Test thoroughly

2. **Update WordPress Article**
   - Change permalink to: `/is-my-cifeaux/`
   - Replace all `[LIVE URL]` with: `https://ccff00.com/is-my-cifeaux/`
   - Add featured image
   - Publish

3. **Commit Final Code to GitHub**

   git add .
   git commit -m "Production-ready cPanel deployment with database"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Launch Social Campaign**
   - Use content from `03-social-content.md`
   - Update URLs to production
   - Post across all platforms

### Week 1:

- [ ] Monitor phpMyAdmin for incoming results

---

## Lessons Learned

**1. URL consistency matters**
Didn't establish `/projects/` base path early → had to update everything. Now config enforces it.

**2. Deployment platform shapes architecture**
Switching from Vercel to cPanel added database integration opportunity → better product.

**3. Adaptive > static**
Original 6-colour linear test was fine. Adaptive 15-colour version is significantly better UX.

**4. Backend adds value**
Database enables: result tracking, public dashboards, A/B testing, insights.

**5. Google Analytics essential**
Need both GA (user behavior) and database (test results) for complete picture.

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

**Database not saving?**
- Check `config.php` credentials
- Verify user has ALL PRIVILEGES
- Check browser console for errors
- Test save-results.php directly

**Google Analytics not tracking?**
- Verify measurement ID: G-N498PE7E7L
- Check Real-Time reports (takes ~30 seconds)
- Look for gtag errors in console

**500 Error?**
- Check PHP error logs in cPanel
- Verify file permissions (644 for .php)
- Test PHP version (needs 7.4+)

## Final Thoughts

Brand ownership isn't filing trademarks. It's building infrastructure.

This test is one artifact in the CCFF00 ecosystem:
- Style guides
- Colour tests ← you are here
- Design systems
- Accessible palettes
- Interactive tools
- Educational content
- Results analytics

Each piece reinforces the brand. Each tool ships value. Each artifact proves range.

**If Pantone can own colour systems and Tiffany can own robin's egg blue, you can own cifeaux—but only if you build the infrastructure to prove it.**

Ready to deploy.

**Project Status:** ✅ Production-Ready
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Build Time:** 8 hours (including pivot and rebuild)
**Next Action:** Deploy to cPanel following CPANEL-DEPLOYMENT.md

---

**Note on Security:**
- NEVER commit `config.php` with real credentials
- Keep `.gitignore` updated
- Use environment variables for production if possible
- Regularly backup database
