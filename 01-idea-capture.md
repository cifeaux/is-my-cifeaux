## The Core Idea

An interactive web tool inspired by ismy.blue that tests whether colours are "close enough" to the official #CCFF00 (cifeaux). Users see 6 shades spanning yellow-to-green and answer "Is this cifeaux?" for each. Results show where they draw the line vs. the crowd, with a humorous verdict.

## Why This Matters

**Connection to manifesto:**
- [x] Proves range
- [x] Demonstrates AI capability
- [x] Cultural relevance
- [x] Owns #CCFF00 narrative
- [x] Brand education disguised as play
- [x] Shows velocity

**Why ship this?**
To own a colour culturally, you need tools that teach people what it is. This is whimsical brand education that establishes authority over what counts as "real" cifeaux while being genuinely useful for designers/developers. Inspired by the viral success of ismy.blue (1.5M+ visits in a month).

## Core Mechanic (Adapted from ismy.blue)

**Original:** Binary blue/green choices across 6 shades, reveals personal perception bias
**Cifeaux Version:**
1. Show 6 shades spanning yellow-green around #CCFF00
2. Binary choice: "Is this cifeaux?" (yes/no)
3. Shades include:
   - Too yellow (#FFFF00)
   - Close yellows (#EEFF00, #DDFF00)
   - **The One True Cifeaux (#CCFF00)**
   - Close greens (#BBFF00, #AAFF00)
   - Too green (#99FF00)
4. Results: Gradient showing user's acceptance range vs. crowd
5. Verdict labels: "Purist" / "Expansive" / "Heretic" / "Visionary"
